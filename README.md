## **Getting Started with This Repository in RStudio**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **File > New Project > Version Control > Git**.
3. In the dialog box:
   - **Repository URL**: Paste the URL of this repository:  
     `https://github.com/tallosfarkas/pmp_tm1_bonds.git`
   - **Project Directory Name**: Choose a folder name for the project.
   - **Create Project As Subdirectory Of**: Select the folder where you'd like to save the project.
4. Click **Create Project**.

This will clone the repository and set it up as a new RStudio project.

### **Step 2: Open the Project**
1. After cloning, RStudio will open the project automatically.
2. If it doesn't, navigate to the folder you cloned and double-click the `.Rproj` file (e.g., `TM1_PortfolioStrategies.Rproj`).

---

### **Step 3: Install Required Libraries**
Ensure that the necessary R libraries are installed. Open the R Console and run the following:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readxl"))
```

---

### **Step 4: Load the Data**
The data for this project is saved in an `.RData` file named `Bond_all.RData`. To load it into your R environment:
1. Open the file `load_and_e_ret.R` in RStudio.
2. Add the following code at the start of the file:
   ```R
   load("Bond_all.RData")
   ```
3. Run the script to load the data into the R environment.

---

### **Step 5: Start Working**
The loaded data will now be available in your R environment. You can use the variables and objects within `load_and_e_ret.R` to calculate excess returns or analyze bond strategies. Follow the comments in the script for further steps.

## **Git Workflow: Collaborating and Version Control**

### **When Starting Work**
Before making changes to the files, ensure you are working with the latest version of the repository:
1. Open the RStudio Terminal or use an external terminal.
2. Run the following command to fetch the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
   This updates your local repository with any new commits from the remote repository.

### **Making and Saving Changes**
1. After working on the file(s) and saving your changes in RStudio:
   - Stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

   ```bash
   git push
   ```
   This ensures your changes are shared with others using the repository.

---

### **Example Workflow**
Hereâ€™s a full example workflow:
```bash
# Pull the latest changes before starting work
git pull

# Make changes to your files
# Then stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Updated load_and_e_ret.R with additional analysis"

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push
```

---

### **Repository Structure**
- **`Bond_all.RData`**: Contains the bond data for analysis.
- **`load_and_e_ret.R`**: Script to load the data and calculate excess returns.
- **`PAPER.pdf`**: Reference document related to the analysis.
